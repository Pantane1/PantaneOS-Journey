# 🌌 PantaneOS — My Journey to Build a Full Operating System

Hi, I’m **Pantane**, a full-stack developer on a mission to build my own **mobile operating system** — something modern, aesthetic, and deeply personal.

This repo is my **digital journal + blueprint**, where I’m documenting every step — from early ideas to working prototypes.

---

## 💡 The Vision

PantaneOS is more than just software — it’s a **vision of freedom, design, and intelligence**.
A world where devices feel human, personal, and connected.

Think of it as:

> “Android’s flexibility, iOS’s polish, and Pantane’s soul.”

The goal is to create a **fully custom phone OS**, built on open technology but with a unique identity — one that integrates creativity, design, and AI at its core.

---

## ⚙️ What I’m Building

There are two main tracks:

### 1️⃣ The Real OS Layer

A forked Android (AOSP-based) system where I’ll rebuild:

* System UI (Launcher + Status Bar)
* Core apps (Settings, Messages, Dialer)
* OTA update system
* Cloud + AI integrations

### 2️⃣ The Visual / Functional Prototype

A **Flutter**-based UI prototype (home screen, icons, apps) that simulates how the system will look and feel before I compile my own image.

This runs on both **Web** and **Android Emulator**.

## 🧠 The Stack

| Layer           | Tools / Frameworks                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Kernel          | Linux (AOSP)                            |
| Build System    | AOSP repo / make / bazel                |
| UI Prototype    | Flutter                                 |
| System Apps     | Kotlin + Flutter integration            |
| Backend         | Node.js / Go + Firebase for early tests |
| Design          | Figma / Uizard                          |
| AI Tools        | ChatGPT, Replit Ghostwriter, DhiWise    |
| Repo Management | GitHub + GitHub Actions                 |
| Testing         | Android Emulator, QEMU                  |

* Define concept & goals
* Design the brand (logo, UI colors, wallpapers)

✅ Completed

---

### **Phase 1 — Flutter Prototype**

* [x] Build a working **launcher screen**
* [x] Add icons, dock, and app simulation
* [ ] Implement “Settings” and “Notifications” demo
* [ ] Add animations & transitions

Prototype folder:
`/prototype/flutter_app/lib/main.dart`

---

### **Phase 2 — System Integration**

* Create Android Launcher APK
* Replace SystemUI in AOSP
* Build custom ROM image
* Test on virtual and physical devices

---

### **Phase 3 — Cloud & Intelligence**

## 🧩 Prototype Preview

```dart
// main.dart (simplified)
MaterialApp(
  title: 'PantaneOS Prototype',
  theme: ThemeData.dark(),
  home: HomeScreen(),
);
```

Run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

This gives you a minimal OS-like home screen with tappable icons and a dock.
The goal is to make it **feel like a real OS** before moving to AOSP.

---

## 💬 My Thoughts

I’m not just coding an operating system —
I’m coding a **statement of independence**.

PantaneOS is my canvas.
Every line of code, icon, and pixel represents something I believe in:
**freedom, simplicity, and creativity**.
